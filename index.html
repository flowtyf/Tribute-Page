         <ul>
            <li><span class=bold>AGE OF STRIFE (M25-M30)</span> - The emperor is a mysterious and ancient immortal being, who's true origins are uncertain.The first mention of the Emperor by that name in Imperial records is when he unified Terra at the end of the Age of Strife in the 30th Millennium.</li>
            <li><span class=bold>THE GREAT CRUSADE (ca. 798.M30-005.M31)</span> - By now the Emperor had emerged as the greatest warlord on Terra, and had the Space Marine legions and Imperial Army under his control. He set out on a crusade to reunite the scattered colony worlds of Humanity in the Milky Way Galaxy under a single government. </li>
            <li><span class=bold>THE HORUS HERESY (ca. 005-014.M31)</span> - The Horus Heresy, sometimes referred to poetically as the "Age of Darkness," was a galaxy-spanning civil war that consumed the worlds of Mankind for 9 Terran years. It began when the Emperors most trusted son, Horus Lupercal, fell to chaos and turned against him. Its outbreak marked the end of the Emperor of Mankind's Great Crusade. </li>
            <li><span class=bold>THE SIEGE OF TERRA(014.M31) - </span> After 55 solar days of fighting, the war was ended by the Emperor of Mankind and Horus duelling in single combat aboard Horus' flagship, the Gloriana-class Battleship Vengeful Spirit. The Emperor was mortally wounded in the conflict, but managed to strike down Horus for good. At His own direction, his crippled body was installed into the cybernetic life support mechanisms of the psychic amplifier known as the Golden Throne.</li>
            <li><span class=bold>PRESENT (M40+) -</span> The Emperor has sat immobile, His body slowly crumbling, within the Golden Throne of Terra for over 10,000 standard years. The Emperor's decaying physical form is preserved by the vast arcane machinery of the Golden Throne, which itself is maintained by a legion of Tech-priests from the Adeptus Mechanicus. His psychic essence is spread out across the whole of the galaxy through the Warp, watching over as much of Humanity as He can manage in His current depleted state, in order to keep the Ruinous Powers of Chaos at bay.  </li>

WHISPER HIS PRAYERS WITH DEVOTION, FOR THEY WILL SAVE YOUR SOUL. HONOUR HIS SERVANTS, FOR THEY SPEAK IN HIS VOICE. TREMBLE BEFORE HIS MAJESTY, FOR WE ALL WALK IN HIS IMMORTAL SHADOW."</p>
